Aelius is an ongoing free software, open source project aiming at developing a suite of Python, NLTK-based modules and interfaces to external freely available tools for shallow parsing of Brazilian Portuguese. It also includes language resources such as language models, sample texts, and gold standards. Presently, Aelius already offers facilities for POS-tagging and chunking corpora and outputting annotations in different formats, such as in XML in the TEI P5 encoding scheme.
